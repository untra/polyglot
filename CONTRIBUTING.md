# Welcome to Polyglot contributing guide
Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project! Any contribution you make will be reflected on https://polyglot.untra.io âœ¨.

This guide covers steps for interested contributors to polyglot source code, documentation or example website.

## Running tests

If you make any contributions to ruby source code, I will request you add a test to the spec.

In the spec/ directory there are a series of ruby spec files.

run tests with `test.sh`.
rebuild the gem and example site with `make.sh`.
