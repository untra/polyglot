Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project! Any contribution you make will be reflected on https://polyglot.untra.io ✨.

## Running tests

If you make any contributions to ruby source code, I will request you add a test to the spec.

In the spec/ directory there are a series of ruby spec files.

run tests with `bundle exec rspec --format RspecJunitFormatter`
