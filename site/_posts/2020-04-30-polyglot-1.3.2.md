### `lang_from_path` setting to derive document lang from relative path

This release adds a new boolean configuration setting `lang_from_path`. When set to true, this option tells polyglot to derive the base language from a matching subpath if the lang frontmatter is not set. This setting works well in conjunction with other translation maintenance tools such as [po4a](https://po4a.org/).

### relative and absolute url relativization improved logic

`excluded_from_localization` files will have trailing slashes added to their paths if they are directories. In addition, these files will be matched differently in the relativize and absolute url regex matchers. This will improve the accuracy of url relativization based on user feedback.
