A new version of Polyglot has been released! Give it a try!

{% highlight yaml %}
gem install jekyll-polyglot

This release was made possible with the support of the following github users:
* [vlsi](https://github.com/vlsi)
* [pserwylo](https://github.com/pserwylo)

### Recursively merge language specific `site.data`
Language specific content defined in your `site.data` directory will now be recursively merged together, so that `active_lang` content gets precedence over `default_lang` content, gets precedence over language non-specific content. ([#59](https://github.com/untra/polyglot/pull/59))

### Still build unassigned files to the `default_lang` site root
If the `default_lang` is not defined in the `languages`, this ensures that language unassigned files (such as those excluded from localization) are still written out to the site root. ([#65](https://github.com/untra/polyglot/pull/65))

### Performance improvements and fixes for `i18n_headers` tag
Document processing is now faster, and fixes were made to the i18n_headers for when the site.url is defined. ([#67](https://github.com/untra/polyglot/pull/67))

### Custom keys for `active_lang` site payload
This allows custom keys to be defined with the `active_lang`, giving interoperability between polyglot and other plugins and themes. ([#68](https://github.com/untra/polyglot/pull/68))
