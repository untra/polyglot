Jekyll-Polyglot 1.9.0 has been released, which has minor dependency updates, and instructional improvements for getting the most from your multi-language website.

## Community provided instructional improvements

Thank you to **[aturret](https://github.com/aturret)** for helping to maintain the existing `zh-CN` site pages. 谢谢！

**[george-gca](https://github.com/george-gca)** improved the optional `derive_lang_from_path` configuration to better identify document language from the path inference. Tests were added for his helpful [feature improvement PR](https://github.com/untra/polyglot/pull/222). This improvement helps infer the language of posts and pages missing `lang` frontmatter, from any part of the document filepath.

Github user **[yunseo-kim](https://github.com/yunseo-kim)** submitted a [instructions to improve sitemap generation](https://github.com/untra/polyglot/pull/230) . To help with SEO, a website should have only one root sitemap.xml , and not have duplicates for each sub-language site. Be sure to add the `sitemap.xml` to the `exclude_from_localization` configuration.
