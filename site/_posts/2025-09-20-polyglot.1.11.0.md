Jekyll Polyglot 1.11.0 has been released. It has fixes for tricky bugs that have been challenging to solve until recently. This release is possible thanks to fellow contributors and users like you.

## fixed conflicts with jekyll themes

Other jekyll themes such as [miminal-mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/_config.yml#L168-L169) or [chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy/blob/master/_config.yml#L208-L210) use glob patterns in `exclude:` configurations which would previously conflict with polyglot processing websites with url relativization. [@mattions](https://github.com/mattions) contributed a fix to `regex.escape` these values before being applied to the relativization regexes.

This adjustment should help with using polyglot out-of-the-box with other common jekyll themes.

## other miscellaneous fixes

* [:polyglot, :post_write hook correctly passes site](https://github.com/untra/polyglot/pull/266)
* [i18n_headers x-default value correctly matches site url](https://github.com/untra/polyglot/pull/262)
* [codecov and ci adjustments](https://github.com/untra/polyglot/pull/263)

## support for japanese and arabic

The polyglot website now has translated support versions in [arabic](https://polyglot.untra.io/ar/) and [japanese](https://polyglot.untra.io/ja/). These site translations were made with the help of AI ; if anything is mistranslated please contribute better corrections!
