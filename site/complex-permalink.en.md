This permalink is really long and complex.

And this page is relativized and coordinated with copies for each supported language by `page_id`.

If you use `jekyll-redirect-from` and a customized [redirect.html layout](https://github.com/untra/polyglot/blob/main/site/_layouts/redirect.html), this permalink will be redirected when viewed from different languages.
